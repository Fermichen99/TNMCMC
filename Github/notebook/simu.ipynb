    "## 1. Project Goal & Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to simulate the **3D Edwards-Anderson (EA) spin glass model** with open boundary conditions. A major challenge in simulating spin glasses, especially at low temperatures, is **critical slowing down**, where traditional local-update Monte Carlo methods (like single-spin flips) become extremely inefficient at exploring the system's complex energy landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, the project implements two distinct algorithms:\n",
    "1.  A standard **Metropolis Monte Carlo** algorithm as a baseline.\n",
    "2.  A more advanced **Tensor Network Metropolis-Hastings (TNMH)** algorithm, which performs non-local, collective updates on large blocks of spins to accelerate convergence."

    "## 3. Deep Dive into the TNMH Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The TNMH algorithm is a method designed to perform efficient, non-local updates. Instead of flipping one spin at a time, it proposes a collective update for a large 3D block of spins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TNMH Workflow Step-by-Step\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SimulationTNMH` function follows a structured, multi-layered loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Disorder Loop:**\n",
    "The outermost loop iterates from `idis in 1:pa.Ndisorder`, just like the standard Metropolis. This ensures results are averaged over many different random spin glass instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Thermalization and Sampling Loops:**\n",
    "Inside the disorder loop, there are standard `itherm` and `isamp` loops for thermalization and measurement. The key difference is what happens inside each simulation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The \"Sweep\":**\n",
    "A single \"sweep\" in this algorithm is highly sophisticated and consists of three main parts:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   **a. Directional TNMH Block Updates:**\n",
    "   The code iterates through a set of directions (e.g., `:zyx2yxz`, etc.). This ensures that the blocks being updated sweep through the 3D lattice in different ways to avoid bias. For each direction, the algorithm does the following:\n",
    "   * It iterates through the entire 3D lattice, selecting **overlapping 3D blocks** of spins of size `zchunk x ychunk x xchunk`.\n",
    "   * **Tensor Network Construction (`InitTensor`)**: For a selected block, it builds a local tensor network representation. The bond dimension `chi` is used here to compress the environment information, making the calculation feasible.\n",
    "   * **Block Sampling (`TNMH_oe`)**: It then samples a **brand-new configuration for the entire block** from the probability distribution described by the tensor network. This is a massive, collective move that can cross energy barriers that would be impossible for single-spin flips.\n",
    "   * **Metropolis-Hastings Acceptance (`Accept`)**: The proposed update for the entire block is then accepted or rejected based on the standard Metropolis-Hastings criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire three-part process constitutes one step in the `itherm` or `isamp` loop."
